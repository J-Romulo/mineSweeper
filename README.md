This project is a classic implementation of the popular game, Mine Sweeper. It's built using TypeScript to study the applications of SOLID principles and design patterns.
The project is loosely inspired by the "[Objects Calisthenics](https://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/2012/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf)" coding challenge, which promotes writing cleaner and more maintainable code through object-oriented design.
